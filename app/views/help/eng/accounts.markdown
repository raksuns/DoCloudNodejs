# How to Add Accounts

If you have an administrator-level account, you can manage your organization's DocumentCloud accounts and settings by clicking the "Accounts" tab at the top of the workspace:

In the Accounts tab, you can edit your name, change the email address you use to log in and update your password. Our avatar graphics come from [Gravatar][]. Create an account there if you like, but your avatar doesn't appear outside of the workspace.

Along with personal settings, administrators will see the name of their organization in the left sidebar. Clicking the organization name reveals a list of its accounts. Each existing account can be edited by clicking the pencil icon next to it.

To add an account, click "New Account" and fill in the user's first and last names, email address and account level.

DocumentCloud supports three categories of users in any organization: **administrators**, **contributors**, and **freelancers**.

 * **Administrators** can create new DocumentCloud accounts and disable old ones. Assign administrative privileges to as many users as appropriate.

 * **Contributors** can upload, annotate and edit documents, and they can access documents shared across the organization.

 * **Freelancers** can upload, annotate, and edit their own documents and any documents that have been explicitly shared with them. Freelancers do not have access to the rest of your organization's documents.

You may also wish to learn more about reviewers and other [collaboration][] tools or read up on DocumentCloud [privacy][].
